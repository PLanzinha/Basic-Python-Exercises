# Exercise 26 - Check Tic Tac Toe

# As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. However, this is significantly more
# than half an hour of coding, so weâ€™re doing it in pieces.
# Today, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON a game of Tic Tac Toe, not worrying about how the
# moves were made.
