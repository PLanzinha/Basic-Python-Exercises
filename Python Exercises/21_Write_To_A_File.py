# Exercise 21 -  Write To A File

# Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some
# different code, use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results
# to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.
# Extras:
# Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
