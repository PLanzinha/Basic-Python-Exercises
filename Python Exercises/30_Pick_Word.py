# Exercise 30 - Pick Word

# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.

# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS
# dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s
# compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a
# single word.

import random


n_words = 0

with open('sowpods.txt', 'r') as open_file:
    read_text = open_file.read()

    lines = read_text.split()

    n_words += len(lines)

    rand_word = random.choice(lines)

# print(n_words)
print(lines[0])
# print(lines[267750])
print(rand_word)
